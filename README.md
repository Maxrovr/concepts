# Tech Interview Concepts
A repository for all concepts I am learning. I am currently following *Gayle Laakmann McDowell's* `Cracking The Coding Interview`. You can too!

Check out my [website](https://rakshithsm.com) and [blog](https://rakshithsm.com/blog) for more.

## The story so far..
1. Sorting
    1. [Merge Sort](https://github.com/Maxrovr/concepts/blob/master/python/sorting/merge_sort.py) ([Original](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort/tutorial/))
    2. [Quick Sort](https://github.com/Maxrovr/concepts/blob/master/python/sorting/quick_sort.py) ([Original](https://www.interviewbit.com/tutorial/quicksort-algorithm/))
    > :trophy:I highly recommend sketching out the sorting process on paper for multiple examples

2. Recursion and Dynamic Programming(DP)
    1. A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs. ([Solution](https://github.com/Maxrovr/concepts/blob/master/python/recursion_and_dp/8.1_Triple_Step.py))
    2. Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right. (1's in the grid are "navigateable" and 0's are not) ([Solution](https://github.com/Maxrovr/concepts/blob/master/python/recursion_and_dp/8.2_Robot_In_A_Grid.py))
